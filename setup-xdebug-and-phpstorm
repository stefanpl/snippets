Debugging PHP in PHPStorm

- go to Settings --> PHP --> Debug. Run the 'validate' script. Should show no errors.

- do everything as it says here: https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/Zero-configuration+Web+Application+Debugging+with+Xdebug+and+PhpStorm

- be sure to actually LISTEN for incoming connections in PHPstorm

- be sure the requests have the right cookie value set (XDEBUG_SESSION=PHPSTORM)

- find out what's going on, add it to this file
